# Plandex self-hosting üè†

## Quick start script ‚ö°Ô∏è

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex.git
cd plandex/app
./start_local.sh
``` 

## Requirements

The Plandex server requires a PostgreSQL database (ideally v14), a persistent file system, git, and these environment variables (if using the docker build command below):

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/plandex # replace with your own database URL
export GOENV=production
export SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
export SMTP_PORT=587
export SMTP_USER=user
export SMTP_PASSWORD=password
export SMTP_FROM=user@example.com # optional, if not set then SMTP_USER is used
```

Or, if you are using the `docker compose` option below, cp `app/_env` to `app/.env` and set the values in that file.

### PostgreSQL Database

A user and database needs to be created in postgres. If you use [docker-compose](#using-docker-compose) this will be done when the postgres container starts. Otherwise:

```sql
CREATE USER 'user' WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE DATABASE 'plandex' OWNER 'user';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE 'plandex' TO 'user';
```

## Using Docker Build

It can be run from a Dockerfile at `app/Dockerfile.server`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex.git
VERSION=$(cat app/server/version.txt) # or use the version you want
git checkout server/v$VERSION
cd plandex/app
mkdir ~/plandex-server # or another directory where you want to store files
docker build -t plandex-server -f Dockerfile.server .
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/plandex-server:/plandex-server \
  -e DATABASE_URL \
  -e GOENV \
  -e SMTP_HOST \
  -e SMTP_PORT \
  -e SMTP_USER \
  -e SMTP_PASSWORD \
  plandex-server
```

## Using Docker Compose

If you don't have, or don't want to spend the time to setup a PostgreSQL server, you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
cd plandex/app
cp _env .env
# edit .env to set the required environment variables for postgres
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

## Run From Source

Or you can run it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex.git
cd plandex/
VERSION=$(cat app/server/version.txt) # or use the version you want
git checkout server/v$VERSION
cd app/server
export PLANDEX_BASE_DIR=~/plandex-server # or another directory where you want to store files
go run main.go
```

## Notes

The server listens on port 8080 by default.

The server requires access to a persistent file system. If you're using Docker, it should be mounted to the container. In production, the `/plandex-server` directory is used by default as the base directory to read and write files. You can use the `PLANDEX_BASE_DIR` environment variable to change this.

In production, authentication emails are sent through SMTP. You can use a service like SendGrid or your own SMTP server.

### Development Mode

If you set `export GOENV=development` instead of `production`:

- Authentication tokens will be copied to the clipboard instead of sent via email, and a system notification will pop up to let you know that the token is ready to paste. (SMTP environment variables are not required in development mode.) The pin will also be output to the console.

- The default base directory will be `$HOME/plandex-server` instead of `/plandex-server`. It can still be overridden with `PLANDEX_BASE_DIR`.

### Health Check

You can check if the server is running by sending a GET request to `/health`. If all is well, it will return a 200 status code.

### Create a New Account

Once the server is running, you can create a new account by running `plandex sign-in` on your local machine.

```bash
plandex sign-in # follow the prompts to create a new account on your self-hosted server
```

### Note: Local CLI Files

If you use the Plandex CLI and then for some reason you reset the database or use a new one, you'll need to remove the local files that the CLI creates in directories where you used Plandex in order to start fresh. Otherwise, the CLI will with an account that doesn't exist in the new database and you'll get errors. This could also happen if you use Plandex Cloud and then switch to self-hosting.

To resolve this, remove the following in any directory you used the CLI in:

- `.plandex-dev` directory if you ran the CLI with `PLANDEX_ENV=development`
- `.plandex` directory otherwise

Then run `plandex sign-in` again to create a new account.

If you're still having trouble with accounts, you can also remove the following from your $HOME directory to fully reset them:

- `.plandex-home-dev` directory if you ran the CLI with `PLANDEX_ENV=development`
- `.plandex-home` directory otherwise
